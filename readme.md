The "references" above are the second set of brackets: [another place] and [another-link]. At the bottom of a Markdown document, these brackets are defined as proper links to outside websites. An advantage of the reference link style is that multiple links to the same place only need to be updated once. For example, if we decide to make all of the [another place] links go somewhere else, we only have to change the single reference link.

>Reference links don't appear in the rendered Markdown. You define them by providing the same tag name wrapped in brackets, followed by a colon, followed by the link.

In the box below, we've started writing out some reference links.
 >You'll need to finish them up! Call the first reference tag "a fun place", and make it link to www.zombo.com; make the second link out to www.stumbleupon.com.
